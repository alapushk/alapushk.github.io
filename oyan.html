            <h4>Elevator Pitch</h4>
            <p>OYAN is a platform that supports protesters by helping them
              coordinate the demonstrations using GPS and Bluetooth technology.
              It provides users with an interactive map that displays area
              safety status, ongoing protest-related media, and a live chat
              for protest participants that runs without the Internet.</p>

            <h4>Name History</h4>
            <p>The series of protests that broke out in Kazakhstan at
              the beginning of this summer was tagged as #oyan protests.
              "Oyan" from Kazakh means 'To wake up'. By using this tag,
              the political activists and other demonstration participants
              agitated the citizens to finally start taking actions towards
              making a political statement, rather than hide or stay quiet
              about the issues. </p>

            <p>Protests play an important part in the civil, political,
              economic, social and cultural life of all societies. They inspire
              positive social change and the advancement of human rights in all
              parts of the world.</p>
            <p>For instance, in 2019, Ivan Golunov, a Russian investigative
              journalist, was arrested based on drug-dealing charges. However,
              the charges turned out to be fabricated as they were an attempt
              to halt his widely reported articles on Russian government
              corruption. The only reason why the charges were eventually
              dropped and Golunov was released is due to an international
              solidarity/protest campaign that blew up both online and
              on the streets.</p>

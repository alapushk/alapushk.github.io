            <h4>Elevator Pitch</h4>
            <p>OYAN is a platform that supports protesters by helping them
              coordinate the demonstrations using GPS and Bluetooth technology.
              It provides users with an interactive map that displays area
              safety status, ongoing protest-related media, and a live chat
              for protest participants that runs without the Internet.</p>

            <h4>Name History</h4>
            <p>The series of protests that broke out in Kazakhstan at
              the beginning of this summer was tagged as #oyan protests.
              "Oyan" from Kazakh means 'To wake up'. By using this tag,
              the political activists and other demonstration participants
              agitated the citizens to finally start taking actions towards
              making a political statement, rather than hide or stay quiet
              about the issues. </p>

            <p>For instance, in 2019, Ivan Golunov, a Russian investigative
              journalist, was arrested based on drug-dealing charges. However,
              the charges turned out to be fabricated as they were an attempt
              to halt his widely reported articles on Russian government
              corruption. The only reason why the charges were eventually
              dropped and Golunov was released is due to an international
              solidarity/protest campaign that blew up both online and
              on the streets.</p>

              To finalize the application workflow and design, our team went
              through numerous iterations. At first, to understand and evaluate
              planned functionalities, we created preliminary sketches and
              grey box wireframes. Then, we started refining our visual
              direction and creating interactive prototypes of the interface
              workflows for further testing.

            Design iterations for map layers
          </div>
          <p>
            One of the key application features is the interactive map in the
            protest mode because it has a high frequency of use and it provides
            important information about area safety during the protest. For this
            feature, users will use the interactive map to view safety status and
            current media uploads. Therefore, information architecture and
            graphic design of the app are of the most importance.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">design 1</p>
          <p>As the interactive map communicates various types of information to
          the users, such as safety status and media uploads, the screen could
          get unnecessary crowded. We wanted to give users freedom to view the
          data that is most relevant to them at any given time. In order to
          tackle this issue, we adopted the map layers approach that is widely
          used by most of the maps applications. The users can switch between
          the safety heatmap, media uploads or view both at the same time.</p>
          <p class="lead">design 2 and 3</p>
          <p>The original design of the interactive map was in a dark mode, with
          red location icons representing media uploads. However, after careful
          revision, my team and I made some changes to the approach. We realized
          that the dark mode would not be comfortable to use during the day due
          to the low contrast between the map elements. We also introduced a new
          warning icon to represent safety status alerts. Thus, we changed the
          location icons to circles for the media uploads in order to better
          differentiate the icons. While in both design 2 and 3, we used the same
          methods to communicate map data, the main navigation bar is only present in
          design 2.</p>
          <p class="lead">final design</p>
          <p>After testing the application with target users, we used the insights
          to improve the functionality of the map. All of the test participants
          stated that the blue colour in the safety index was confusing.
          The suggested improvement was to use the traditional colour palette that
          uses green to indicate the safest status. We also changed the appearance
          of the map layers dialog to match the overall style of the application.</p>

            <p>Filters feature on the Programs page wasn’t used by most students
              (73.3%) as it wasn’t clear or noticeable enough. After showing this

            One of the key catalogue features is the filter bar because it allows
            users to narrow down their search for the right type of program or course.
            There are numerous offerings with different types of degrees, and delivery
            methods in the catalogue. Therefore, user interface design of the filter bar
            is important for easy navigation.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">Original design</p>
          <p>As we found out from the usability study, the filter bar was not
          noticeable enough for most users (73.3%). The original colors of the filter
          bar were too light and did not grab users attanetion. The dropdown fields
          had the same light grey background color as the bar itself.</p>
          <p class="lead">Design 1 and 2</p>
          <p>In the first and second design iterations, we explored potential solutions
            to making the fiters more usable. Design 1 explored splitting filters
            into two groups: primary and secondary filters. The primary filters were
            displayed as dropdowns with white background while the secondary filters
            were hidden in an expandable area and were displayed as radios. This
            design aimed to reduce the amount of information load that was readily
            available to users in the filters tab. Design 2 reduced the amount of
            filters available and displayed the two chosen ones in a form of radio buttons.</p>
          <p class="lead">Final design</p>
          <p>After a careful examination, we refined Design 1 to create a final
            version of the filters tab. In this version, filters are displayed as
            dropdowns with a white background and a contrasting border. The
            overall background color of the filters tab is also darker to further
            increase the contrast and grab users attention. After the redesign
            was launched on the website, we used Hotjar to view the heatmaps of
            the Programs and Courses pages, which revealed that the filters are being used.</p>

          While this study improved the usability of Programs & Courses catalogue,
          specifically, the use of filters, there is still more room for
          improvement. More studies need to be done to incorporate the faculty
          pages into the catalogue to provide a smoother user experience for students.
